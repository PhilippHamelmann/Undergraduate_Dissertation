The R scripts "analysis_base.R", "analysis_homophily_sex.R" and "analysis_decay.R", correspond to the models in sections 2, 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, respetively.
The R scripts "analysis_norm.R" and "analysis_lim_time.R" are extensions that are not presented in the dissertation, but might be of interest to the reader.
  "analysis_norm.R" is similar to the "analysis_decay.R" expect that the exonential distribution is replaced by a truncated normal distribution
  "analysis_lim_time.R" limits the maximum time at which matches can be created
Due to their large size, the regression models created by the above scripts are only available upon request.
